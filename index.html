      <h3>Bodensee Weißensberg GC</h3>
      <div class="golf-paragraph">
        <p>This picture-postcard golf course was modelled into the gentle foothills of the Alps close to the lake of constance, designed by Robert Trent Jones sr. The 18 hole course is regarded as one of the most challenged in Europe and provides athletic golfers with just the right amount of pressure: long, narrow fairways, almost 100 bunkers, and numerous water hazards. All guests can enjoy the beautiful view of the Swiss Alps from the large sun terrace of the hotel and restaurant.</p></td>

      <h3>GC Augusta National GC</h3>
      <div class="golf-paragraph">
        <p>Augusta National Golf Club, located in Augusta, Georgia, is one of the most famous golf clubs in the world. Founded by Bobby Jones and Clifford Roberts on the site of the former Fruitland (later Fruitlands) Nursery, the course was designed by Jones and Alister MacKenzie and opened for play in January 1933. Since 1934, it has played host to the annual Masters Tournament, one of the four major championships in professional golf, and the only major played each year at the same course. It was the top-ranked course in Golf Digest's 2009 list of America's 100 greatest courses and was the number ten-ranked course based on course architecture on Golfweek Magazine's 2011 list of best classic courses in the United States.</p>
